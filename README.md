### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- Hi, Iâ€™m Reece
- Iâ€™m interested in coding in C
- Iâ€™m currently learning how to fix PC issues
- I'm originally from Hawaii
- I'm a Senior in Electrical Engineering (SDS track)
- I chose my major because it seemed intresting at first.
- A fun fact about me is: I know matlab code
- What do I want to learn from EE 205?  How to code better and more effectively.
- A book or movie I'd recommend is:  Traditions and Encounters: A Breif Global History Volume II From 1500 to the Present 4th edition
